# Steam compare
Provided two steam users ids compares the games between the two users and shows the shared games and how much each user has spent in the game.
## Doesn't this already exist in steam?
This was made before I realised that It does exist in steam. And this was a learning oppurtunity to learn the steamApi and understand the server side in sveltekit
## Usage
Clone the repository and make a `.env` file inside it at the top level. Add a `STEAM_API_KEY` value with your steam api key then run the program using `npm run dev -- --open`
